# Python Foundations to Libraries – Practice Notes and Projects 🐍📚

Welcome to my curated collection of Python practice notebooks! This repository showcases my hands-on learning journey in Python, covering both foundational concepts and essential libraries used in Data Science and Machine Learning. Each folder contains structured practice notebooks and mini-projects with explanations, examples, and applied use cases.
